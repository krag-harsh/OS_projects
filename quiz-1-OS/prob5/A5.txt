If there is a need of protection, paging or multitasking, then will use the long mode, else i will be using real mode.
As real mode is sufficient for RAM size till 1MB, it is faster than long mode(due to smaller register size and absence
of decriptor table) also long mode would require more space to run(which is already very low in our system)
